# Thesis Political Campaign Strategies - Twitter
This is a tiny project meant to do two things:

* Scrape the tweets of politicians, and format them into a csv. This is done by scraper.py.
* Take a csv with previously mentioned tweets with their contexts, and another csv with the amount of tweets per context required, which then creates a csv file with randomly selected tweets according to the amount of tweets required. This is done by tweet-selector.py. Additionally, it searches for wrongly encoded tweets.
